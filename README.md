## Heap
A heap is a tree based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

2 types of heaps:

    Binary Max Heap
    
    Binary Min Heap


## Priority Queue
Priority queues are abstract data structures meaning it can be implemented by multiple data structures.

1: It could be implemented using just a queue. However, for each insertion, a sorting will take place to ensure the priority is correct.

2: It could also be implemented using a heap. A heap will adjust the priority automatically using bubble up/down after each insertion.
