## ``How to convert a char into its ascii value``
ord('a') -> 97

ord('a') - 97 = 0

## How to check if a char is a digit or a letter
char.isnumeric()   -> checks if a char is a digit/number

char.isalpha()    -> checks if a char is a letter

## ``How to sort an array by multiple values``

## ``DFS & BFS``
DFS uses a stack

BFS uses a queue

## ``Heap``
A heap is a tree based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

2 types of heaps:

    Max Heap
    
    Min Heap

Although it's very common to see heap being binary, it's not always the case.

Trees cannot contain cycles. So, heaps cannot contain cycles too.

## ``Priority Queue``
Priority queues are abstract data structures meaning it can be implemented by multiple data structures.

1: It could be implemented using just a queue. However, for each insertion, a sorting will take place to ensure the priority is correct.

2: It could also be implemented using a heap. A heap will adjust the priority automatically using bubble up/down after each insertion.
